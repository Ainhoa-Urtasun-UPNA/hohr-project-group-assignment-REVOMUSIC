## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.
***
At the beginning we were three managers, one operator and one engineer. The predictions of the number of available workers are: one manager, one engineer and two operators.

***

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.

***
The forecast of the number of workers needed are 4 managers, 12 engineers and 7 operators. Considering the predictions of the number of available workers, there will be a shortage of 3 managers, 11 engineers and 5 operators. Therefore, the strategy Revomusic will carry out will be an upsizing strategy, regarding managers, the best alternatives might be either increase the workweek or the overtime for the managers, and also hire new managers. The same could be applied to engineers. Regarding operators it is more advisable to hire more workers instead of increasing workweek and overtime, as their work is based on routine and it is more physical, besides, their salaries are lower so it is affordable to hire more operators. Attending to the automation risk of this occupation, which is higher to 90%, another solution could be to replace some operators workplaces by machinery.
***

## Task 5
* Objective: Post 1 job vacancy for each occupation to work on remote by describing the tasks and skills required. Use [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/l-Remote-jobs.html) for help. 
* Regarding our predictions of necessity and availability, we have came to the conclusion that there will be a shortage in the three occupations of Revomusic. As for the managers, it has been decided to increase the workweek and overtime so the necessity of managers can be partially compensated, nevertheless, we will still need 2 new managers. Regarding engineers, the same solution is thought to be optimal, so instead of 11 engineers, which would mean too many new workers for our company, 8 engineers will be hired and the work-hours needed will be achieved by increasing their workweek and overtime. Lastly, as for the operators, we have decided that increasing the workweek and overtime may be not an effective solution as their work is more routinary and physical. Nevertheless, attending to this occupation automation risk, we have decided to invest in machinery to replace workers, so the operators needed will be just 3, as their tasks will be reduced by the implantation of machinery.  
* Job opening: 2 managers, 8 engineers and 3 operators
